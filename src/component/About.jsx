      First of all, thank you so much for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself in front of you.

My name is Khushi Pancholi. I live in Godhra with my parents. My father is a businessman and my mother is a homemaker.

I have completed my bachelor's degree in commerce from Godhra and I have just finished my last semester exam for master of social work from Mahatma Gandhi Labour Institute, Ahmedabad.

Along with my master's, I have done my internships in the District child protection unit as an administrator, Social worker, and at Tata motors a Csr and ER role.

My field interest is in HR and mainly I want to work as an HR executive.

That's all about myself.

Thank you.
